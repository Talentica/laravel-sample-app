==================

ToDo list web application using laravel and angularJs

Vagrant up should bring up something on 10.10.10.2. Add a host to your hosts file called talentica.dev pointing to 10.10.10.2
and see if talentica.dev/info.php says HipHop. If it does, you just got served a php page via HHVM.
